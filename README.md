# FlappyBird

This is a simple FlappyBird project made to experiment with the Unity Game Engine for the first time. 
The goal of this project was to get familiar with Unityâ€™s core concepts like physics, object instantiation, and basic C# scripting for 2D games.

## About the Project

- Built in Unity as a learning exercise  
- Code written with the help of online tutorials and community resources  
- Images used in the game were sourced from free online assets  
- Only the `Assets` folder is uploaded here, as it contains all relevant scripts, sprites, and Unity objects
